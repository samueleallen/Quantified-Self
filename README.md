# Quantified-Self

Authors: Gavin McClure-Coleman & Sam Allen

### Purpose:
Our project helps paint trends in a user's games played on Steam, a common digital distribution system and storefront by Valve. Specifically, we analyze genres played, average playtime statistics, and review sentiment compared to games played. Additionally, we trained four classifier algorithms on our playtimes to predict whether a game was reviewed positively or negatively by the community as a whole. 

This project is useful for any Steam player trying to figure out general patterns in the games they play. This project was mostly built to be a fun project. We were specifically curious about how our own data compared to one another more than anything else. This project helped us find any similarities that we shared, and we found many.

### Outside Users
If any outside users wish to analyze their own Steam data and compare it with friends, they should first fetch their own Steam API key from this website [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Afterwards, you must then find your Steam ID, which can be located in your Account Details on Steam. Next, you can use our defined functions to get your user games, and similarly, if you wish to compare your data with others, you can use our merge function as defined in the utils file.
